# Testnet Postmortem Analysis Data

This repository contains kernelDB, cosmos DB, and/or slogfiles for various iterations of the Agoric testnet. It can be used to perform after-the-fact performance analysis of these chains, as well as providing a corpus of data for developing new monitoring tools.

The large files are stored using [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/), so you'll need to install that first, before cloning the repository.
